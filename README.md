A minimalist typing speed test application built with vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

2. Type the displayed text as accurately as possible
3. Completed characters turn **white** (correct) or **red** (wrong)
4. Press **Space** to move to the next word
5. Use **Backspace** to correct mistakes
6. View your results (Time, Accuracy, WPM) when finished
